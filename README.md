   - Get Google API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)

2. **Ollama Setup** (for Llama and DeepSeek):
   - Install Ollama from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)
   - Pull the models:
     ```bash
     ollama pull llama3.2
     ollama pull deepseek-r1:8b
     ```
   - Start Ollama service locally

## How to Run

### Local Development

1. **Backend Setup**:
   ```bash
   # Navigate to backend directory
   cd backend

## Environment Variables
Update the .env file in the backend directory with your API keys:

```plaintext
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key_here
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_key_here
 ```

## Notes
- OpenAI and Google Gemini services require valid API keys in the .env file
- Llama and DeepSeek services require Ollama to be running locally on port 11434
- The application allows switching between different AI models through the interface
